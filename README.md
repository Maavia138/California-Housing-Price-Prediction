# California Housing Price Prediction

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow to predict median house values in California using linear regression. The Jupyter Notebook covers data loading, exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data loading and initial exploration
- Handling missing values and categorical data
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Train-test split
- Linear regression implementation
- Model evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²)

## Dataset

The dataset contains California housing information with features like:
- Longitude/Latitude
- Housing median age
- Total rooms/bedrooms
- Population
- Households
- Median income
- Ocean proximity
- Median house value (target)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook

## Results

The linear regression model achieved:
- Mean Squared Error: 4,908,476,721.16
- Root Mean Squared Error: 70,060.52
- Mean Absolute Error: 50,670.74
- R² Score: 0.63

## Future Improvements

- Try more advanced models
- Feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Address potential overfitting
